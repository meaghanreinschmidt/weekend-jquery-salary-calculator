# Salary Calculator

## Description

*Duration: 1 week*

This project allows you to input your employees from your company and display their first and last name, employee ID, job title, and annual salary. The total monthly salary cost from each employee is then calculated and displayed at the bottom. If an employee no longer works with you, you can easily delete them from your record.

## Usage

1. As a user, I want to be able to enter an employee name, ID, title, and salary into the input fields. 
2. As a user, I want to click the `submit` button and have the employee information appear in the table.
3. As a user, I want to be able to see the total monthly salary cost of all the employees combined.
4. As a user, I want to be able to delete an employee from the table if they no longer work with me.
